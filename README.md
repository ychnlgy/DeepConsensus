# DeepConsensus

Using the consensus of low and high level features for robust classification.

This is the (work-in-progress) polished version of code used in our [DeepConsensus paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07266).

The frozen original, experimental code to reproduce the results is found in [this repository](https://github.com/ychnlgy/DeepConsensus-experimental-FROZEN).
